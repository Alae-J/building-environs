You Don’t Blame the Coach**\n\nIf every job you’ve left was because the boss was a flog, the culture was toxic, or the project was “doomed from the start”, maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t them.\n\nLet me tell you a quick one from about six months ago, I interviewed a young CA. In person, presented and communicated really well (must have done to secure roles with the businesses he had done). On paper, it looked like he had range but (more than a bit) jumpy: head contractor, client-side, a few different sectors, but all good reputable employers. But the timeline? All over the shop. Something like 8 employers (7 listed on the resume, I picked up that one had been removed when cross referencing old resumes I had received off him) since around 2018.\n\nNow, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. Life happens. But this bloke had a reason for everything, bad manager, Covid, bad project, company going under, toxic culture (used that phrase three times in under ten minutes). Every single job.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: I took a few backdoor references (quiet chats with former employers). And the story was very different. Turns out it wasn’t the projects, or the managers, or the company health. It was him. Performance, attitude, consistency – or lack thereof. He thought he was a Grade A operator. Truth is, he wasn’t even playing the right sport. Well presented, great comms, but run out of rope to continue in the top end of the industry.",
