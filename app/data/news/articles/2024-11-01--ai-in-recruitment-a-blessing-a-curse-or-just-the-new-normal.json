Red Flags Everywhere:**\n\nRecruiters can smell AI from a mile away. Repeated adverbs, flowery phrases, and generic layouts? Dead giveaways. While we love efficiency, it's no replacement for individuality.\n\n**3. When AI Gets It Wrong:**\n\nLet's not forget the candidate who let AI craft a cover letter claiming non-existent experience.
