Further, as we move out of the pandemic and immigration is 'turned back on' (fingers crossed), the 'talent shortage' we are currently witnessing will likely need to be filled by talented overseas migrants.",

I feel most overseas candidates are highly motivated to learn, develop and transition into the local market while relying on a solid skill-set and a wealth of experience from an international market. In fact, people relocating halfway around the world are often more motivated and 'tuned in' to working hard and bettering themselves (I might be a bit biased, as an immigrant myself).",

It's often time-consuming and costly for companies to sit back and wait for positions to remain vacant for long periods while waiting for that elusive candidate. But my view is that the best employers and managers currently have access to the skills they need but don't back themselves to harness them.",

Builders (Head Contractors mostly) are the ones suffering as a consequence of their inability to train and develop talented people with transferable skills from overseas. Therefore, it makes a whole heap of sense for changes to come from within and employers to consider candidates they previously would notâ€”whilst setting up better training and development for new starters who do not have the perfect local experiences.",

Yet, the pandemic has seen construction workers leave and immigration stop, so we need to take a proactive and more flexible approach to hiring. Employers who are better positioned to employ, train and develop talent who have immigrated to Melbourne could find themselves without the same headaches as those struggling to find the perfect candidate, 'with local experience'.",

Obviously, more technical questions should be asked at the interview stage. But, Headway DNA gives precise data around a person's capability to perform tasks at varying levels of complexity. So, if they have the soft skill capability to perform to the level of complex work and the personality to fit the business, there is an excellent opportunity for employers who can mentor or train and develop these talented people to get them up to speed. Where they are from should not be an issue.",
