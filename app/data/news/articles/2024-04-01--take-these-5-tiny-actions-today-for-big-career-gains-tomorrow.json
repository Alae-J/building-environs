Start by arranging a casual coffee chat with your manager and ask, 'What can I improve?' (Hint: If your manager is the type of person who hates surprises, make sure you give them a heads up on the topic of conversation so they can prepare.)\n\nAsking for feedback demonstrates your commitment to personal development.
