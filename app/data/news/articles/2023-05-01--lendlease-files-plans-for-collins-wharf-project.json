Residents will enjoy a slew of premium facilities, including a concierge, podcast studio, pet facilities, arts and crafts room, business lounge, music room and private dining rooms.\n\nThe 6.5ha site will be home to five towers in total when the project is completed. A total of 1,500 residences will be constructed, with Development Victoria overseeing the project.\n\nThe planning win comes as Lendlease warns of a hit to its earnings from local housing development, which Global CEO Tony Lombardo has blamed on higher interest rates and delayed sales across its residential arm.",
