At the time, it signalled that global investors believed demand for CBD office spaces was still strong â€“ despite anecdotal reports suggesting otherwise.\n\nThe group invested $236 million in the purchase, following an earlier purchase of 446 Collins Street in 2021 for $72 million.\n\nThe 330 Collins' upgrade project appointment signifies another achievement for Alchemy Construct, which has gone from strength to strength since its inception.\n\nNotably, the firm's work on Pascoe Vale Primary School has been widely heralded, with the project winning the 2022 Excellence in Construction Under $3M Master Builders Association of Victoria Awards.",
