And the panic is setting in.\n\nIf you feel tempted to get on the front foot – and shoot your resume to anyone who'll have it – our advice for the first 48 hours might come as a surprise:\n\nSit tight. Do nothing.\n\nLet us explain.\n\nIf knowledge of the collapse becomes public – and you're active on LinkedIn or employment sites like Seek – you'll start receiving phone calls almost immediately from recruiters.\n\nThese early birds are racing to place you in any new position they can find. And collect a quick, easy and juicy fee.\n\nThis is precisely why you *shouldn't* sign with those recruiters, or send your CV, without taking some time to have an informed conversation (or three). Because panicking and taking the first job a transactional recruiter finds for you is a recipe for regret.\n\nInstead, treat this like any other job change. And take your time to decide what you want from your next position – and your next recruiter.\n\nBut if you *really* just can't sit still, there is one thing you can do in the first few days: update your CV, or your LinkedIn profile, in preparation for the impending recruitment rodeo.
