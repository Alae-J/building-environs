            "content": "It’s no secret that recruiting for potential is often a gamble (particularly if you have a poor recruitment process). But with the right approach, you can minimize the risk and maximize the reward:\n\n1. **Look for Patterns of Growth**: A standout CV isn’t about job titles or company logos; it’s about upward movement. Has the candidate taken on more responsibility over time? Are they showing a hunger to learn and evolve? Growth beats stagnation every day of the week.\n\n2. **Assess Reflective Abilities**: As George Abraham said recently when he joined me on *The Building Talks Podcast*, the ability to reflect and grow from feedback—without attaching emotion—is a hallmark of high-potential candidates. Look for those who are curious, coachable, and resilient.\n\n3. **Don’t Be Blinded by Polish**: AI-generated cover letters are flooding inboxes faster than spam emails offering free holidays. But while these documents might dazzle on the surface, it’s the substance underneath that matters. The best talent doesn’t need AI to exaggerate their experiences—they’ve got tangible wins, real-world results, and the scars to prove it.\n\n4. **Check Their Motivation**: Potential thrives in the right environment. Are they here to grow, contribute, and make an impact, or are they simply chasing a paycheck? A candidate’s genuine motivation often determines how far they’ll go in your organization.\n\n**Top Tip:** Craft interview questions that dig deep into these areas—then compare candidates’ responses. You’ll be amazed at how clearly the diamonds stand out."

            "content": "Potential isn’t just a nice word to slap on a CV. It’s something you need to actively pursue. Here’s how to make sure you’re on track to being the superstar your CV claims you are:\n\n1. **Embrace Feedback Without Fear**: As George Abraham wisely noted, feedback is a gift. Leave your ego at the door and take every piece of advice as an opportunity to grow. The fastest way to unlock your potential is to learn from your mistakes (and yes, we all make them).\n\n2. **Master Your Craft**: Want to be the Martin Ødegaard of your field? Then you need to go all in. Ødegaard didn’t become Arsenal’s captain by casually kicking a ball. He trained, adapted, and worked tirelessly. The same goes for your career. Master your craft, whatever it is.\n\n3. **Find an Employer Who’ll Challenge You**: A good employer will push you out of your comfort zone and give you the tools to thrive. Look for companies that invest in mentorship, training, and opportunities to grow.\n\n4. **Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable**: Growth happens outside your comfort zone. Take on challenging projects, solve tough problems, and stretch yourself. That’s where the magic of potential lies.\n\n**Top Tip:** Remember, your potential doesn’t live in the safety of your comfort zone—it lives in the chaos of the unknown. Get out there and embrace it."
