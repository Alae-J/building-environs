A cool $500 million.\n\nThe Melbourne Ritz Carlton opened earlier this year and is the first in the city. The Perth venue has operated for two years.\n\nWhile the consortium hasn't held the venues for long, a representative told the Financial Review that the sales are 'for capital recycling and is consistent with our stated group's strategy.'\n\nFar East Consortium will retain and focus attention on its other Melbourne and Perth hotels, which are part of the Dorsett Hotels portfolio.",
